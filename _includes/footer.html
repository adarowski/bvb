  <h3>About this Site</h3>
  <p>This fan site is dedicated to Borussia Dortmundâ€™s first womens squad. Our ladies are playing their first season in the seventh tier of German football, in the Kreisliga A (Group 2).
    Iâ€™ll be providing squad information, statistics, and match reports (as much as I possibly can) as the team begins its climb up the German football pyramid.</p>
  <p>This site is not affiliated with Borussia Dortmund.</p>
